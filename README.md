Image Processing Fundamentals with Processing.
First You need to download the Processing software from "https://processing.org/download" to your PC and run the 'main.pde' file.
These are fundamental concepts of image processing begins from brightness,contrast changing,automatic contrast and goes until filters,edge detection,live histogram,etc.
This project consider the gray level 8-bit images only.
There could be errors and wrong applications of algorithms.
I'm developing this project to learn image processing concepts and like to share it with you.
Thank you !
